=head1 SYNOPSIS

This can be used to update the contents of a variable containing a list of
files in a makefile.

    use Makefile::Update::Makefile;

=func update_makefile

Update variable definitions in a makefile format with the data from the hash
ref containing all the file lists.

Only most straightforward cases of variable or target definitions are
recognized here, i.e. just "var := value", "var = value" or "target: value".
In particular we don't support any GNU make extensions such as "export" or
"override" without speaking of anything more complex.

On top of it, currently the value should contain a single file per line with
none at all on the first line (but this restriction could be relaxed later if
needed), i.e. the only supported case is

    var = \
          foo \
          bar \
          baz

and it must be followed by an empty line, too.

Notice that if any of the "files" in the variable value looks like a makefile
variable, i.e. has "$(foo)" form, it is ignored by this function, i.e. not
removed even if it doesn't appear in the list of files (which will never be
the case normally).

Takes the (open) file handles of the files to read and to write and the file
lists hash ref as arguments.

Returns 1 if any changes were made.
