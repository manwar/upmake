=head1 SYNOPSIS

# Variables in our input files use make-like $(var) syntax while CMake uses
# shell-like ${var}, so convert to the target format.
sub _var_to_cmake
{
    my ($var) = @_;
    $var =~ s/\((\w+)\)/{$1}/g;
    $var;
}

=func update_cmakefile

Update variable definitions in a CMake file with the data from the hash
ref containing all the file lists.

The variables are supposed to be defined in the following format:

    set(var
        foo
        bar
        baz
    )

Notably, each file has to be on its own line, including the first one.

Takes the (open) file handles of the files to read and to write and the file
lists hash ref as arguments.

Returns 1 if any changes were made.
